## Setting up a Development Environment 
1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. Run `poetry install` in the root directory

## Launching the dashboard
Activate the environment and launch the dashboard script.
``` 
poetry shell
streamlit run src/dashboard-prototype.py
```
## Editing the dashboard 
You can edit the script while the dashboard is live. Pressing `R` while viewing the dashboard will refresh/rerun the script allowing you to view changes without re-launching the dashboard via the command line.
